# Biicode configuration file

[requirements]
    # Blocks and versions this block depends on e.g.
    google/gtest : 9

[parent]
    # The parent version of this block. Must match folder name. E.g.
    # user/block  # No version number means not published yet
    # You can change it to publish to a different track, and change version, e.g.
    sqlite/sqlite: 7

[paths]
    # Local directories to look for headers (within block)
    include
    /
    sqlite3

[dependencies]
    # Manual adjust file implicit dependencies, add (+), remove (-), or overwrite (=)
    include/SQLiteCpp/Assertion.h - tests/Database_test.cpp
    include/SQLiteCpp/Assertion.h - examples/example1/main.cpp

[mains]
    # Manual adjust of files that define an executable
    # !main.cpp  # Do not build executable from this file
    # main2.cpp # Build it (it doesnt have a main() function, but maybe it includes it)

[hooks]
    # These are defined equal to [dependencies],files names matching bii*stage*hook.py
    # will be launched as python scripts at stage = {post_process, clean}
    # CMakeLists.txt + bii/my_post_process1_hook.py bii_clean_hook.py

[includes]
    # Mapping of include patterns to external blocks
    gtest/gtest.h: google/gtest/include


[data]
    # Manually define data files dependencies, that will be copied to bin for execution
    # By default they are copied to bin/user/block/... which should be taken into account
    # when loading from disk such data
