-------

"sqlite3.c" and "sqlite3.h" files from sqlite-amalgamation-3300100.zip (SQLite 3.30.1 2019-10-10)

Those files are provided for easy setup and compatibility under Windows/Linux/MacOS.
They are used by default by the CMake build.

Use -DSQLITECPP_INTERNAL_SQLITE=OFF to link against the Linux "libsqlite3-dev" package instead.
