/**
 * @brief RAII encapsulation of a SQLite Transaction.
 *
 * A Transaction is a way to group multiple SQL statements into an atomic secured operation;
 * either it succeeds, with all the changes committed to the database file,
 * or if it fails, all the changes are rolled back to the initial state.
 *
 * Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII) means that the Transaction
 * begins in the constructor and is rollbacked in the destructor, so that there is
 * no need to worry about memory management or the validity of the underlying SQLite Connection.
 *
 * This method also offers big performances improvements compared to individually executed statements.
 *
 * Thread-safety: a Transaction object shall not be shared by multiple threads, because :
 * 1) in the SQLite "Thread Safe" mode, "SQLite can be safely used by multiple threads
 *    provided that no single database connection is used simultaneously in two or more threads."
 * 2) the SQLite "Serialized" mode is not supported by SQLiteC++,
 *    because of the way it shares the underling SQLite precompiled statement
 *    in a custom shared pointer (See the inner class "Statement::Ptr").
